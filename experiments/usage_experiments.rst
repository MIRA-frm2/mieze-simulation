Experiments
###########

Any general setup can be implemented using the `Base Class <https://github.com/MIRA-frm2/mieze-simulation/blob/master/experiments/experimental_setup/setup.py.py>`_.
It contains general methods commonly needed for all experiments, and an abstract method 'create_setup' that has to be
defined in the derived experiment class that actually implements the setup.
