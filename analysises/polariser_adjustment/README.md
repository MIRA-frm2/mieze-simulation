Polariser equation adjustment
=============================

The magnetic field of the polariser on the y axis is a magnetic dipole, ideally. In practice however, there are some 
slight differences. The magnetic field of the polariser at several locations has been recored and it is used here to 
adjust the coefficients (a, n) of the the magnetic dipole equation: y = a * x ** n

The result is plotted [here](./by_bx.png).
