Adiabatic Transition
====================

The magnetic field along x and y direction are plotted together with the angle change in [this plot](./by_bx.png).

The actual adiabatic transition condition can be found in the literature, but for convenience we provide 
[two slides](./adiabatic_transition_literature.pdf) about it.

This condition is then plotted together with the actual change of the angle in the 
[Adiabatic transition plot](./adiabatic_transition_condition.png).
