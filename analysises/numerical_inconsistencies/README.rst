Numerical inconsistencies
*************************

Looking at the results for different number of points in the computatioanl grid:

* `200 points <https://github.com/MIRA-frm2/mieze-simulation/blob/master/analysises/numerical_inconsistencies/200points.png>`_

* `250 points <https://github.com/MIRA-frm2/mieze-simulation/blob/master/analysises/numerical_inconsistencies/250points.png>`_

* `300 points <https://github.com/MIRA-frm2/mieze-simulation/blob/master/analysises/numerical_inconsistencies/300points.png>`_

* `1000 points <https://github.com/MIRA-frm2/mieze-simulation/blob/master/analysises/numerical_inconsistencies/1000points.png>`_

One observes that the results are quite different. One should investigate how to minimize this effect.
