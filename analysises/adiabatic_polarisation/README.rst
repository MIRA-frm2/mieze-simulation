Adiabatic Polarisation
***********************

This analysis focuses on studying the adiabacity of the magnetic field.

1. A  `check  <https://github.com/dprelipcean/mieze-simulation/blob/master/analysises/adiabatic_check/scripts/adiabatic_check.py>`_ using the existing parameters.

    This condition is then plotted together with the actual change of the angle in the
     `Adiabatic transition plot  <https://github.com/dprelipcean/mieze-simulation/blob/master/analysises/adiabatic_check/results/adiabatic_transition_condition.png>`_.

    The magnetic field along x and y direction are plotted together with the angle change in  `this plot  <results/by_bx.png>`_.

    There is no user input for this analysis.
