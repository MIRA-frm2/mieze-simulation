Neutron polarisation evolution
*******************************

The polarisation is computed for each voxel based on how much time the neutrons spends in the respective voxel, given 
its speed.

The magnetic field and the polarisation vector are then plotted together.

For the magnetic field of the coil set only, the result is `here  <https://github.com/MIRA-frm2/mieze-simulation/blob/master/analysises/neutron_polarisation_simulation/results/polarization_and_bfield_coilset.png>`_.
