These files are automatically generated by the various scripts. It contains:

* The general/complete magnetic field for the setup in data_magnetic_field.* files

* The individual magnetic field for each element in the `elements_magnetic_fields folder <https://github.com/MIRA-frm2/mieze-simulation/blob/master/data/elements_magnetic_fields>`_

* The metadata, ie. parameter values used to generate this magnetic field data in the `*_metadata.txt file <https://github.com/MIRA-frm2/mieze-simulation/blob/master/data/data_magnetic_field_metadata.txt>`_

The magnetic field is either stored in either of the two formats:

* Tabular data, as .csv file

* Pickled python objects, as .pkl file(binary files), that can be used to transfer python objects (yes, objects!) amongst
